##  Circumstances of programs

Most fuctions made. No draw function working, I don't know how to get those to work. Shape class not finished.

The program was developed and tested on replit.com and Visual Studio 2019

## How to build and run the program

** 1. Uncompress the homework.**  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       `% unzip [PA6]`

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
   ```
        main.cpp
        Canvas.cpp
        Circle.cpp
        Line.cpp
        Rectangle.cpp
        Shape.cpp
        Square.cpp
        Triagnle.cpp
        Canvas.hpp
        Circle.hpp
        Line.hpp
        Rectangle.hpp
        Shape.hpp
        Square.hpp
        Triagnle.hpp
        makefile
        README.md (this file)
   ```
** 2. Build the program.**

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [PA6] 

    Compile the program by running make command:
    % make

** 3. Run the program by: **
   `% ./timedemo`

** 4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by **
   `% ./make clean`
